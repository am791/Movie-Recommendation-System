# Movie-Recommendation-System
A Python based Model to determine movie recommendations to the users based on their older ratings and watching history.

Algorithms implemented for recommendations:
- Content based filtering
- Item-item based collaborative filtering
- Popularity based filtering

### How to run the project:

- Clone the project to a directory.
- Open the code file ``` Movie_recommendation.ipynb ``` on ``` google colab ``` (https://colab.research.google.com).
- Upload the files ```u.data ``` and ```u.item ``` to your google drive. 
- In the code file, change your drive directory accordingly to access the above two files.
- Run the first cell of the code and give the access to your drive.
- Now you are ready to go for running other cells and see the results.
